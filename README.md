# Getting Started
Use `npm install` to install Spooder's dependencies.

Then use `npm run init` to initialize your Spooder's configuration.
Note: You will need app access credentials from dev.twitch.tv. Fill in the client ID and secret to authenticate.

Finally use `npm run start` to start Spooder's web and OSC services.

Open Spooder's Web UI in your browser either by localhost:3000 or your local network address at port 3000.

# User Authentication
Authentication will only work on localhost, the machine Spooder is running.

Log into Twitch.tv as the broadcaster and click Authorize at the top right. Once done, Spooder will store your user access token and log you in to chat automatically unless you start Spooder with `npm run start-noautologin`.

Go to the EventSub tab and click "Save Current Oauth as Broadcaster." The broadcaster Oauth is used for pulling channel point custom rewards. Once done, you may log out of Twitch.tv and back in as a bot account. Then click authorize to store and use your bot's Oauth for chat if you wish.

# UDP Clients
One last necessity is the UDP clients. Those are machines with software listening for OSC like Resolume, Max, and Ableton. Define the IP and port of the machine, add to the clients list, and save your config. They should show up in the events tab for configuring software type commands.

# Creating Events
Events have two triggers. A chat command and channel point reward. Make sure to save your broadcaster oauth to link channel point rewards.

Commands:

Response - Write a script to build your bot's response to the trigger and return a string. Use the Verify Script button to ensure the script works. Red border means there's an error which will show in the console.

Plugin - Choose a plugin and event name to send the event data to. This will go through the plugin's onEvent function.

Software - Make sure you set up your udp machines in the Config tab. This command will send an OSC command to the specified address to the specified machine. "Timed" events send the OSC at valueOn until the set duration, then send the OSC at valueOff. "One Shot" events send valueOn and then valueOff immediately with the duration used as a cooldown instead.

# The Help Command
The help command is set in the config. It's prefixed with ! in the backend so no need to prefix it on Config. It works like '!help <type> <command>'. The types are event and plugin. To see a full list of events, call `!help event`. Then with the listed commands, call `!help event command` to see the command's description. This also works with plugins if they're set in the commandList object. By itself, the help command introduces your Spooder to new viewers. The introduction is also set on Config.

# Moderating Spooder
Spooder comes with two big chat commands for moderation. !stop will stop any event currently running. You can use it like '!stop eventname' to stop a certain event (The event name is the initial name set when the event was created). You can also use '!stop all' to stop all running events. !mod is the base command for you and your mods to lock/unlock events and plugins or adding and removing names from the user blacklist. The 'all' argument works for lock and unlock as well. So you can use '!mod lock all' to lockdown Spooder entirely and use '!mod unlock all' to lift all Spooder's locks. Knowing all the event names and the consistant changes to the events and plugins that may be. I recommend using the new Mod UI. More information about Accessing Externally below.

# Creating/Managing Plugins
Plugins take in the same data Spooder's events do and how they work is entirely up to you. Check out the sample plugin repository to get started with making plugins. The Plugins tab in Spooder's Web UI can install plugins by uploading the plugin as a zip file. Once installed, you can configure the plugin's settings, upload assets to the plugin, and export the plugin. Note: Exported plugins will not include its assets folder.

# OSC Tunnels
These tunnels simply listen for OSC from overlays or software and repeat them to another address. So that software like TouchOSC can control other devices or overlays.

# Accessing Externally
Some of Spooder's features require an https url to access through the internet. EventSubs, Channel Point Rewards, and the Mod UI need this. One way to do this is to set up a free ngrok.io account. You will need two tunnels. One with the web server's hosting port and one with the TCP OSC port. Be sure to set both of them as http tunnels as the TCP tunnel is by websocket. Doing this with ngrok is fairly simple, but I will be posting tutorial videos soon. Once both tunnels are running, save them to your config on external_http_url and external_tcp_url.

# EventSubs
Note: callback_url has moved to the Config tab as external_http_url.
With the broadcaster username set in config and broadcaster oauth saved, you can subscribe to events with that broadcaster. 
Each subscription can be handled in any combination of ways like events. The only difference is being able to send event data straight to an overlay like an alertbox. Send to plugin doesn't have a field for event name as it is already named as the event subscribed (e.g. channel.follow).

channel.channel_points_custom_reward_redemption.add and update are needed to link custom rewards to Spooder events. That won't need any handler enabled on the EventSub tab.

# Connecting to OBS
Check out Deck Mode in the Web UI and you'll find the OBS Remote. Enter your OBS machine's info to connect. Spooder connects to OBS on the backend with a custom OSC front to control it. The controls are pretty basic now, but there's more to come.

# The Mod UI
If you've set up both external tunnels in the Config, you can share the web tunnel link to your mods as it is with '/mod' at the end of it. The Mod UI will ask your mods for authorization and will check to see if they are a mod on your channel. Once authorized, your mods have access to Spooder's locks, blacklist, and plugin utilities in a simple GUI. This interface is also themable and mods can synchronize their themes across all their devices connected. So a mod can login on desktop to edit their theme and then login on mobile. Click sync on desktop to synchronize the desktop's settings with the mobile's settings.

# Developing Web UI and Mod UI
Use `npm run dev` to run Spooder in development mode. This sets the web UI's hosting port to 3001. In another shell, use `npm run start-front` to run the web UI's development server which will run on port 3000 like usual. Use `npm run build-front` to create an optimized build for the web UI. When built, Spooder can be started up normally with your changes to the web UI.
